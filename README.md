# Simple Discord Bot

This is my first discord bot, just exploring what we can do with the discord.js library !

## Usage

1. clone this repository to get started
1. run `yarn install` to install package and dependencies
1. copy `.env.example` file and rename it `.env`, insert your token, your application client id and your server id.
1. once finished, run `yarn dev` to launch nodemon or `yarn start` to run the code.
